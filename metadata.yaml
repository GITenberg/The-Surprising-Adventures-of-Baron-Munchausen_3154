description: It is a curious fact that of that class of literature to which Munchausen
  belongs, that namely of Voyages Imaginaires, the three great types should have all
  been created in England. Utopia, Robinson Crusoe, and Gulliver, illustrating respectively
  the philosophical, the edifying, and the satirical type of fictitious travel, were
  all written in England, and at the end of the eighteenth century a fourth type,
  the fantastically mendacious, was evolved in this country. Of this type Munchausen
  was the modern original, and remains the classical example. The adaptability of
  such a species of compositi.
